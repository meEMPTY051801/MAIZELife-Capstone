                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern corn leaf blight occurs commonly in most areas of the Midwestern U.S. where corn is grown. Yield losses are typically minimal but can become significant with susceptible hybrids or inbreeds. The disease can cause significant grain loss if susceptible hybrids are infected before silking.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Northern corn leaf blight (NCLB) is a disease of corn caused by the fungus, Exserohilum turcicum. Severe outbreaks of the disease can cause up to 30-50% yield loss in dent corn if the disease is established before tassel. NCLB also causes significant reduction in quality in sweet corn and silage corn. This publication will outline how to identify the disease, review its lifecycle, as well as appropriate management options for growers.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>SYMPTOMS</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Typical symptoms of northern corn leaf blight are canoe-shaped lesions 1 inch to 6 inches long. The lesions are initially bordered by gray-green margins. They eventually turn tan colored and may contain dark areas of fungal sporulation. The length or size of lesions may vary with in different corn hybrids reactions with different resistance genes. Lesions begin on the lower leaves and then spread to upper leaves. Severe symptoms can progress rapidly, resulting in blighted leaves. The disease can be confused with symptoms of Goss's leaf blight on some hybrids, and perhaps with Stewarts wilt where this disease occurs.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>CONDITIONS AND TIMING THAT FAVOR DISEASE</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease is most prevalent during moderate temperatures (64 to 80 degrees F) with prolonged periods of moisture. It typically appears at or after silking, but the disease is usually more severe when infection occurs earlier.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preventative management strategies can reduce economic losses from NCLB. Preventative management is especially important for fields at high risk for disease development. In-season disease management options, such as fungicides, are also available.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Management of NCLB can be achieved primarily by using hybrids with resistance, but because resistance may not be complete or may fail, it is advantageous to utilize an integrated approach with different cropping practices and fungicides. Scouting fields and monitoring local conditions is vital to control this disease.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Major (vertical) resistance of corn hybrids comes from the race specific Ht1, Ht2, Ht3, and HtN genes, with the Ht1 gene being most prevalent. Plants with Ht1 Ht2, or Ht3 genes have smaller, chlorotic lesions and reduced sporulation. The HtN gene delays symptoms until after the pollen shed. Individually, each Ht gene has limited effectiveness because there are races of E. turcicum that are virulent in the presence of one or the other. For example, widespread use of the Ht1 gene has reduced the prevalence of the Race 0 to which it has resistance against but has increased Race 1. Breeders are now focusing on incorporating several resistance genes into corn hybrids. Incorporating both the Ht1 and Ht2 provide resistance against both Races 0 and 1. Thus far, this multigenic approach has proven to be effective. However resistant plants still show some symptoms, and the threat of new races showing up lends to the need for other management practices, especially in areas where the disease is present.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ways to change cropping practices to control the disease include reducing the amount of infected residue left in a field, managing weeds to improve airflow and reduce humidity, and encouraging residue decomposition with tillage. The tillage will assist in breaking down crop debris and reducing existing inoculum. In a system with normal tillage, a one-year rotation out of corn can be effective, but a two-year rotation may be required for a reduced-tillage system. If possible, planting in low areas that receive heavy dew and fog should be avoided. A combination of crop rotation for one to two years followed by tillage is recommended to prevent NCLB disease development.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of foliar fungicides for corn have also been shown to control NCLB. Research suggests that using fungicides to keep the upper 75% of the leaf canopy disease-free for three quarters of the grain-filling period will eliminate yield loss To ensure that newly emerging leaf tissue is protected from infection, before the plants are in tassel, fungicides should be applied on the same day that significant conidial dispersal is expected to occur. After tasseling and silking, timing becomes less important since plant expansion will have slowed down. The disease pressure in the field and weather conditions should be monitored and evaluated beforehand to determine if fungicides are needed or not.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cercospora zeae maydis is the most significant yield-limiting disease of corn worldwide .&nbsp; The disease was first reported in Illinois in 1924, and has increased in prevalence throughout corn growing regions since 1988.&nbsp; It is believed that an increase in no-till and conservation tillage farming has contributed to the increase of this disease</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray leaf spot is typically the most serious foliar disease of corn in the U.S. corn belt, although other diseases can be more important in areas and years where weather conditions do not favor gray leaf spot.</p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gray leaf spot requires extended periods of high humidity and warm conditions. It can be confused with other foliar diseases of corn.</p>

                    <p><strong><em>SYMPTOMS</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The disease first appears in the form of small, necrotic spots with halos. These usually expand to become rectangular lesions, about 1/8 inch wide by up to 2 inches to 3 inches long and gray to brown in appearance. Mature lesions usually have distinct parallel edges and appear opaque when put up to the light, but the lesions hybrids vary widely in shape and color. Symptoms can sometimes be confused with northern corn leaf spot, although gray leaf spot lesions are usually limited on the sides by veins.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>CONDITIONS AND TIMING THAT FAVOR DISEASE</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Conditions that favor infection include moderate to warm temperatures during extended periods (greater than 24 hr) of high humidity (greater than 95 percent) or wet weather. Gray leaf spot is a problem in areas with minimum tillage and corn on corn rotations. In susceptible hybrids, the disease typically develops from silking to maturity.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prevention is the best option for management of gray leaf spot as hyphae on plant debris is the primary source of inoculum. There are various cultivars of St. Augustine grass, perennial ryegrass and tall fescue on the market that have variable resistance to gray leaf spot, but none are confirmed as completely resistant. Cultural practices to reduce stress are the next step for gray leaf spot prevention and control. Extended leaf wetness is a requisite for disease development; meaning irrigation time and duration management are essential to reduce long wetness periods and relieve drought stress. Proper mowing technique is another management practice that will assist in control. Turf must be mowed frequently in order to reduce the leaf length and maintain low leaf wetness through increased drying. Removal of clippings can help deter an epidemic in lower intensity situations but is not as feasible or effective on large areas of high intensity. Relief of soil compaction through core aerification improves moisture uptake as well as reducing turf stress. Excessive nitrogen application can cause increase in many diseases and should be regulated through soil testing. Managers should only apply fertilizer while not stressing the turf. Additionally silicon amendments to soils lacking in plant available silicon have been shown to reduce the severity of gray leaf spot. Some developments have also been made in biological control where various bacterium species have been shown as an alternative to fungicides in control of gray leaf spot. Looking at the most common source of control would be the use of various wide spectrum fungicides. The most common active ingredients known to be effective in the control of gray leaf spot are azoxystrobin, trifloxystrobin, thiophanate. Trifloxystrobin and thiophanate are common ingredients in broad spectrum stress guards such as Compass, Exteris and Fame. Azoxystrobin is the most common and effective method used for gray leaf spot and goes by its common name Heritage. All fungicides need to be applied early in the disease cycle as spread is too quick to stop late in the season so most application must be done in early summer. It Must be considered as well that all fungicides have the potential for resistance development when used in large amounts so rotation of various fungicides is recommended.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common rust is caused by the fungus Puccinia sorghi. Late occurring infections have limited impact on yield. The fungus overwinters on plants in southern states and airborne spores are wind-blown to northern states during the growing season. Disease development is favored by cool, moist weather (60 &ndash; 70◦ F).</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Common rust produces rust-colored to dark brown, elongated pustules on both leaf surfaces. The pustules contain rust spores (urediniospores) that are cinnamon brown in color. Pustules darken as they age. Leaves, as well as sheaths, can be infected. Under severe conditions leaf chlorosis and death may occur. Common rust can be differentiated from Southern rust by the brown pustules</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p><strong><em>CONDITIONS AND TIMING THAT FAVOR DISEASE</em></strong></p>
                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The common rust fungus overwinters in the southern U.S. and Mexico. Urediniospores are blown north to the Midwestern Corn Belt in the summer and infection occurs in June or July. Young leaves are most susceptible to infection and pustules are more likely to form after corn silking. The disease favors cool temperatures (60 - 76 degrees F), heavy dews, about six hours of leaf wetness, and relative humidity greater than 95 percent. Temperatures above 80 degrees F suppress disease development and spread.</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The use of resistant maize hybrids is the best way to manage P. sorghi. There are two types of resistance that exist. The first is partial resistance which results in fewer rust spots by reducing germination rate. This type of resistance makes P. sorghi less severe by slowing down development of number of urediniospores. The other type of resistance is qualitative. This type relies on a single gene which provides total resistance to the plant. Other management tactics include foliar application of fungicide and cultural control.For fungicide application, plants should be monitored throughout the season, spraying when there are six or more pustules per leaf. Fungicide groups that can be used include mixed modes of action, DMI Triazoles (Group 3), and QoI Strobilurins (Group 11). Cultural control can be more effective in areas where the spores can overwinter. Debris should be collected and destroyed by burning along with eradication of Oxalis in surrounding areas. In northern areas where the spores can’t overwinter, early planting time can help avoid P. sorghi. Younger leaves are more susceptible to infection, by planting earlier the crop will be more mature and more resilient by the time the spores arrive.</p>
